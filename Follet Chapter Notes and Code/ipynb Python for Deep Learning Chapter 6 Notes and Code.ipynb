    "Our network here underperforms compared to our network in Section 2.1. From the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Part of the problem is that your inputs only consider the first 500 words, rather than full sequences—hence, the RNN has access to less information than the earlier baseline model. The remainder of the problem is that SimpleRNN isn’t good at processing long sequences, such as text. Other types of recurrent layers perform much better. Let’s look at some more-advanced layers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2.2 Understanding the LSTM and GRU layers\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to SimpleRNN, keras also includes LSTM and GRU layers for RNNs. SimpleRNN can't actually learn long-term dependencies due to the *vanishing gradient problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The vanishing gradient problem***: as you keep adding layers to the network, the network eventually becomes untraineable. (For the theory behind this, see Yoshua Bengio, Patrice Simard, and Paolo Frasconi, “Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent Is Difficult,” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 5, no. 2 (1994).)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM and GRU layers are designed to solve this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### LSTM Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM stands for *Long Short-Term Memory* algorithm (see Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber, “Long Short-Term Memory,” Neural Computation 9, no. 8 (1997).). LSTM essentially works as a \"conveyor belt\" that sequence info can jump onto, preserving it for later use and protecting the signals from gradually vanishing during processing. See the book for helpful diagrams showing the process.\n",
